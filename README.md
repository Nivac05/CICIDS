# Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project developed using Python. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook file.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation using various metrics
- Visualization of results

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.9 installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Final_Code_ML_(1).ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the notebook cells to process the data, train the model, and analyze results.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is assumed to be included in the repository or sourced externally.
- Ensure the dataset is in the correct directory as specified in the notebook.

## Model
- Various machine learning models are implemented and compared.
- The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

## Results
